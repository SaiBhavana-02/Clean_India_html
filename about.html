         and communities across India by fostering a culture of cleanliness and sustainability.

         leading to a healthier and more vibrant India.</p>
    
    <h2>Values</h2>
    <p>At Clean India, we are guided by the values of environmental stewardship,
         community engagement, and transparency. We believe in the power of collective action and the importance of individual
