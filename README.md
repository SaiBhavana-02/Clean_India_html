My HTML project, 'Dream India,' aims to promote a clean and green India. Users can upload the locations and conditions of untidy areas to bring attention to high authorities. Additionally, users can share photos of tree planting activities, fostering a greener environment. The project also provides information on oxygen plants, highlighting the importance of greenery for a healthier India.
